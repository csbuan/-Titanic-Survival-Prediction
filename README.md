**Project Summary:** Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

The Titanic disaster, one of the most tragic maritime events in history, claimed the lives of over 1,500 passengers and crew members. The question of what factors influenced survival has long intrigued both historians and data scientists alike. In this project, I sought to answer this question by building a predictive model using Logistic Regression to determine which passengers were more likely to survive the catastrophe.

Leveraging the well-known Titanic dataset, which includes variables such as age, gender, ticket class, family size, and fare, the model was trained to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors. Logistic Regression was chosen for its interpretability and efficiency in binary classification problems. Through careful feature engineering, handling missing data, and tuning model parameters, I was able to optimize the modelâ€™s performance.

The model achieved robust accuracy, highlighting key survival predictors such as gender and ticket class, which played pivotal roles in survival chances. For example, females and those in higher ticket classes had significantly higher probabilities of survival. The model's transparent decision-making process provides insights into these historical dynamics while demonstrating the power of predictive analytics.

This project not only showcases the use of Logistic Regression in solving real-world classification problems but also emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making. Through this analysis, I gained a deeper understanding of the Titanic disaster and the human factors that contributed to survival against the odds.
